                <p>SpringBoard is a Math and English Language Arts (ELA) instructional program for grades 6–12. Developed by teachers for teachers, SpringBoard offers core instructional materials in print and digital that are fully aligned to state standards, Advanced Placement (AP) coursework, and the SAT Suite of Assessments. The Springboard Digital Guide is a website that allows teachers to review the Springboard frameworks and see how it aligns to the national/state requirements.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<h4>The first iteration of the website was tested and users found difficulty finding information where they were supposed to.</h4>
<p>A few pain-points include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information that is considered important is often overlooked and assumed to be part of the footer.</li>
<li>The right rail information is a static section, yet because of how it looked, a lot of users tried to click on it to &quot;see it in action&quot; (content did not help in this instance).</li>
<li>The images were very small and there was no way to enlarge the image.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<h4>There were two types of users, so we created a system where they could find the information they needed, the way they best could.</h4>
<p>As we were reviewing the user feedback and working through the content, we noticed that there were two types of users; some came wanting to know how the Feature related to the standard, while others wanted to know all Features related to a specific standard. Due to this, we decided to create a new Rubrics (standard) section. This section was added to help categorize the Features.</p>

<h2>My Role</h2>
<h4>I was brought in as the visual/UI lead and also worked on parts of the UX.</h4>
<p>I designed the landing page, the &quot;Features&quot; pages, the &quot;How To&quot; page, and was in charge of all imagery.</p>
<p>I used the research findings to start sketching the Features page and thinking of how we could move the information around to make it more useful to our users. Looking at the original design:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to move the first issue to the forefront, after the description.</li>
<li>I also wanted to make the second issue’s section less like a clickable field, and also less prominent, since it was telling the users where they could find the example, and not linking them to them. I worked with a content strategist to make sure the content fit the description.</li>
<li>I also played with the location of the image and also thought about the size and made it so they could view it larger if they wished to.</li>
</ol>
<p>When design was finalized, I spec'd out all the pages for the agency to build and aligned it to our design system the best I could, as some of the elements were custom to the website. I reviewed the work as it was being built in desktop and mobile format to make sure things were translating correctly.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>
<h4>After months of research, design, and build, we launched both the <a href="https://springboard.collegeboard.org/review/ela/">National</a> and <a href="https://springboard.collegeboard.org/review/texas/">Texas</a> ELA guides.</h4>
