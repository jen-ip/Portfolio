<h2>My Role</h2>
<h4>As College Board is migrating their sites, I was brought in to support this update.</h4>
<p>College Board is migrating and refreshing all their sites over the next few years. As the design lead for some of their programs, Membership being one of them, I worked with content strategy, web production, and global standards to make sure that the designs would work with the migration.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Steps We Took</h2>
<p>We first interviewed the product owner to get their user needs. Since this is a relatively small site, we then prioritized the needs and were able to cover all of them. We looked over the structure and content of the existing site and use this time to reorganize and consolidate the site.</p>
<p>Working with the content strategist, multiple iterations of the design and site map were created as we worked to consolidate the six pages of the original site to four. We consolidated the pages because we were aiming for a leaner and more concise site, the previous iteration had a lot of duplicative information. The final site map:</p>

<p>Tell the story of your project in phases. Discovery. Exploration. Design.</p>
<p>These main panel callouts are just one of the many ways that the CollegeBoard seeks to help clear paths to student’s success by educating them on the many opportunities available to them.</p>
