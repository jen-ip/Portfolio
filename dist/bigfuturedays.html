                <p>BigFuture Days</p>
<p>BigFuture Days was created in response to the disruptions in the traditional college planning timelines and processes during COVID-19. Our aim was to create an experience for students that isn't overwhelming, and allows them to establish connections with college admissions professional and current college students that will continue to serve them as they move along their college planning journeys.</p>
<p>BigFuture Days is a series for four virtual events for students.  We like to think of it as part college fair (click into virtual college booths to learn more about a specific institution and be able to chat with an admissions representative from the campus) and part College Planning Conference (where students can attend sessions to learn about and complete important college planning steps like, building a college list, learning about scholarships and financial aid options, or dropping in to ask questions to a live, college advisor).  We built BigFuture Days in response to the disruptions in the traditional college planning timelines and processes during COVID-19.  Our aim was to create an experience for students that isn't overwhelming, and allows them to establish connections with college admissions professionals and current college students that will continue to serve them as they move along their college planning journeys.</p>
<p>It started with a flyer.</p>
